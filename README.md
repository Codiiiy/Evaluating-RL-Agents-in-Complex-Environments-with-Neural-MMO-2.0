# Neural MMO 2.0 Reinforcement Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project trains and evaluates reinforcement learning (RL) agents in **Neural MMO 2.0**, a large-scale persistent environment featuring competition, cooperation, and resource-driven survival. 

## Approaches Explored
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** Capture agent interactions and coordination
- **Enhanced Reward Systems:** Shape agent behaviors efficiently
- **Meta-Learning:** Improve agent adaptability to new tasks

## Risk Considerations
- **Hardware Requirements:** Multiple RL agents require GPUs and memory
- **Software Complexity:** Poorly coded agents may cause errors
- **Scalability:** High agent counts or complex environments may overload the system

## Key Objectives
- Evaluate agent survival over time  
- Measure cooperation between agents  
- Assess team success (number of surviving members)  

## Technologies
- **Language:** Python  
- **Tools:** Docker Hub, VSCode with Dev Container plugin, GitHub  
- **Environment:** Neural MMO 2.0 Starter Kit
